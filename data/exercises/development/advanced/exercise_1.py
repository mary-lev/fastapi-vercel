        "semantic enhancement of a scholarly work so as to improve its discoverability, interactivity, "
        "openness and (re-)usability for both humans and machines. Recently, people have suggested that "
        "the semantic enhancements of a scholarly work should be undertaken by the authors of that scholarly "
        "work, and should be considered as integral parts of the contribution subjected to peer review. "
        "However, this requires that the authors should spend additional time and effort adding such semantic "
        "annotations, time that they usually do not have available. Thus, the most pragmatic way to "
        "facilitate this additional task is to use automated services that create the semantic annotation "
        "of authors' scholarly articles by parsing the content that they have already written, thus reducing "
        "the additional time required of the authors to that for checking and validating these semantic "
        "annotations. In this article, I propose a generic approach called compositional and iterative "
        "semantic enhancement (CISE) that enables the automatic enhancement of scholarly papers with "
        "additional semantic annotations in a way that is independent of the markup used for storing "
        "scholarly articles and the natural language used for writing their content.",
